This is a simple and minimalistic Rainmeter skin with Reddit RSS feed, Karma meter, Twitch live and some add-ons

## Features

- Clean-looking Karma meter
- RSS feed with easy navigation to posts and subs
- Twitch Live panel that shows top 4 active streamers from your follow list
- Dark and light mode support through user actions in Rainmeter
- All settings can be tweaked via one user-friendly settings skin by right-clicking on any skin and choosing **Settings**
- Even more on the way!

## Installation

- Download [latest version](https://github.com/SmileyDrag0n/RSSddit/releases)
- Install the downloaded **.rmskin** file
- By default, setting will open. Change all neccesary parameters to your liking there. More about each setting you can find [here](https://github.com/SmileyDrag0n/RSSddit#settings-and-variables)
- You're all set!

## Authorizing in Twitch Live panel

- If you haven't entered the OAuth token, or it has expired, Live panel will ask you to generate a new one
- In the opened skin, click **Get token** button
- Authorize on the Twitch website
- After authorization, you will be redirected to unresponding localhost. **This is completely normal.** Copy your newly generated token after *&access_token=* from the URL field of your browser, it should look like this:

```url
localost:3000/#access_token=COPYME&scope=user...
```

- Paste the token into corresponding field in the skin and **press enter**
- Click **Log in**
- If you've done everything correctly, Twitch Live panel will now show active streamers

## Settings and variables

## Reddit RSS tips and tricks

Written by [@hiimkir](https://github.com/hiimkir)

- 'www.' in URL is optional
- Add 'old.' to your to RSS URL for your links to lead to classsic reddit (works vice versa too)
- 'https://' is requred for rss to work

### Non-private feeds

- Just add .rss to ***almost*** any reddit page url
- Doesn't matter if it's '.rss' or '/.rss' unless it's reddit.com
- Search results don't work for some reason ([#23](https://github.com/SmileyDrag0n/RSSddit/issues/23))
- Only **posts** will be displayed in widget, so no point in trying to use comment-only feeds (may be fixed)
- **Every** reddit page under this criteria should work, if it doesn't then consider [creating an issue](https://github.com/SmileyDrag0n/RSSddit)
- r/pan, settings and wikis **obviously** don't work

### Private feeds

- Obtainable [here](https://reddit.com/prefs/feeds/)
